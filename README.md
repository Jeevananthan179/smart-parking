# Real-Time Parking Space Monitoring Project

## Overview

This project aims to develop a real-time parking space monitoring system with the following objectives:

- Real-time parking space monitoring.
- Integration with a mobile app for users.
- Efficient parking guidance for drivers.

The project will involve the design and deployment of IoT sensors in parking spaces to detect occupancy and availability. Additionally, a mobile app interface will be created to display real-time parking availability to users. The Raspberry Pi will be used as a central hub to collect data from sensors and update the mobile app.

## Design Thinking Approach

We will follow a design thinking approach to ensure the success of this project:

1. **Empathize**: Understand the needs of drivers and stakeholders by conducting user interviews and surveys.

2. **Define**: Clearly define project objectives, including real-time monitoring, app integration, and parking guidance.

3. **Ideate**: Brainstorm ideas for IoT sensor design, mobile app features, and integration approaches.

4. **Prototype**: Create prototypes for sensors, the mobile app, and the Raspberry Pi setup.

5. **Test**: Gather feedback and test the accuracy of sensors, data collection, and the mobile app.

6. **Refine**: Incorporate user feedback, optimize sensor placement, and fine-tune data collection.

7. **Develop**: Begin full-scale development of the IoT sensor system, mobile app, and Raspberry Pi setup.

8. **Implement**: Deploy sensors, launch the mobile app, and ensure the Raspberry Pi is operational.

9. **Test Again**: Conduct comprehensive testing in a real-world environment and address any issues.

10. **Feedback and Iterate**: Continuously gather feedback, make improvements, and expand the system.

11. **Scale**: Expand sensor deployment to cover more parking areas and explore partnerships.

12. **Evaluate and Maintain**: Regularly evaluate system performance and maintain the infrastructure.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository.

2. Set up the IoT sensors in your chosen parking area.

3. Install the mobile app on iOS or Android devices.

4. Configure the Raspberry Pi to collect data from sensors and update the mobile app.
